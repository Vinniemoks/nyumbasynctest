# 🚀 Deploy Your Site NOW

## The Problem Was:
Your `/dist` folder was in `.gitignore`, so the built React app wasn't being pushed to GitHub Pages!

## ✅ I Fixed It:
1. Removed `/dist` from `.gitignore`
2. Added the dist folder to git
3. Your React app is ready to deploy

## 🎯 Deploy Right Now (3 Commands):

```bash
# 1. Add all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit
git commit -m "Deploy React app to mokuavinnie.tech"

# 3. Push
git push origin master
```

## ⏱️ Wait Time:
- **2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update
- Then visit: https://mokuavinnie.tech

## ✅ What You'll See:
- React login page with NyumbaSync branding
- Blue/purple gradient background
- "Welcome Back" heading
- Email and password fields
- "Sign up" link at the bottom

## 🔄 If Still Blank:
1. **Hard refresh**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. **Clear cache**: Open DevTools (F12) → Application → Clear storage
3. **Check console**: F12 → Console tab (look for errors)

## 🎉 That's It!
Your site will be live in 2-3 minutes after you push!
