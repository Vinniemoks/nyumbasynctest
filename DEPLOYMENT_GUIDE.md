# Deployment Guide for mokuavinnie.tech

## 🚨 Issue Identified

Your site wasn't displaying because:
1. **Old static HTML files** were in the dist folder
2. **React SPA routing** wasn't configured for GitHub Pages
3. **Build output** wasn't being deployed properly

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration
- Set proper base path
- Configured build output directory
- Enabled empty outDir to clear old files

### 2. Added GitHub Pages SPA Support
- Created `public/404.html` for client-side routing
- Added redirect script in `index.html`
- Configured proper routing for React Router

### 3. Created GitHub Actions Workflow
- Automated deployment on push to main
- Builds React app
- Copies CNAME file
- Deploys to GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment configuration for React SPA"
git push origin main
```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build your React app
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Your site will be live at mokuavinnie.tech

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Build the project:**
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Copy CNAME to dist:**
```bash
cp CNAME dist/CNAME
```

3. **Deploy dist folder to gh-pages branch:**
```bash
# Install gh-pages if not already installed
npm install -g gh-pages

# Deploy
gh-pages -d dist
```

4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update

## 🔧 GitHub Pages Settings

Make sure your GitHub repository settings are correct:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Ensure:
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `gh-pages` (or `main` if using Actions)
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
4. **Custom domain**: `mokuavinnie.tech` should be set

## ✅ Verification Steps

After deployment, check:

1. **Visit**: https://mokuavinnie.tech
2. **Should see**: React app login page
3. **Test navigation**: Click signup, should work without page reload
4. **Check console**: No errors
5. **Test routes**: Try /login, /signup directly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Site shows blank page
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear browser cache
# Or open in incognito mode
# Check browser console for errors
```

### 404 errors on refresh
**Solution:**
- The 404.html file should handle this
- Make sure it's in the dist folder after build
- Check GitHub Pages settings

### Old content still showing
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear GitHub Pages cache
# Wait 5-10 minutes
# Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
```

### Build fails
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```
