## Technical Highlights

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in/signs up
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. User data stored in AuthContext
4. Protected routes check authentication
5. Role-based redirect to appropriate dashboard

### Data Flow
1. Dashboard mounts
2. useDashboardData hook fetches all data
3. Statistics calculated from fetched data
4. User performs action (add property, pay rent, etc.)
5. API call made
6. Data refreshed
7. Dashboard updates

### Mock Data System
- Simulates real API with delays
- Allows full testing without backend
- Easy toggle to switch to real API
- Maintains data in memory during session

## How to Use

### Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Test Different Roles
1. Signup as Landlord → redirected to `/landlord-dashboard`
2. Signup as Manager → redirected to `/manager-dashboard`
3. Signup as Tenant → redirected to `/tenant-dashboard`

### Switch to Real Backend
In `src/api/api.js`:
```javascript
this.useMockData = false;
```

Set API URL in `.env`:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api
```

## What's Different from Before

### Before (Static HTML)
- ❌ No routing
- ❌ No authentication
- ❌ No API calls
- ❌ No state management
- ❌ No interactive forms
- ❌ Placeholder data only
- ❌ No role-based access

### After (React App)
- ✅ Full routing with React Router
- ✅ Complete authentication system
- ✅ API integration with mock data
- ✅ Context API for state management
- ✅ Fully functional forms and modals
- ✅ Dynamic data with calculations
- ✅ Role-based protected routes

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Test all dashboards thoroughly
2. Customize styling to match your brand
3. Add more mock data if needed

### Backend Integration
1. Set up your backend API
2. Implement the endpoints from API_ENDPOINTS.md
3. Switch `useMockData` to false

2. Real-time notifications (WebSocket)
3. Payment gateway integration (M-Pesa, Stripe)
4. Document management system
5. Messaging between users
6. Advanced analytics and charts
7. Email notifications
8. Mobile app (React Native)
