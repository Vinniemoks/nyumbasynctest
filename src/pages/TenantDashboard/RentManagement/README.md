## Payment Flow

### Mobile Money (M-Pesa/Airtel/Telkom)
1. User selects payment method
2. Enters phone number
3. Clicks "Proceed to Pay"
4. System validates phone number
5. Initiates STK push to user's phone
6. STK Push Modal displays with countdown
7. System polls payment status every second
8. On success: Shows receipt
9. On failure: Shows error with retry option
10. On timeout: Shows timeout message with retry

### Card Payment
1. User selects "Credit/Debit Card"
2. Card payment form displays
3. User enters card details
4. Real-time validation occurs
5. On submit: Card is tokenized
6. Payment is processed
7. On success: Shows receipt
8. On failure: Shows error with retry option

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Invalid phone number format
- Missing payment method selection
- Invalid card details
- Expired card

### Payment Errors
- Payment initiation failure
- Payment processing failure
- Network timeout
- Insufficient funds
- Card declined

### Timeout Handling

- Clear timeout messaging

## Requirements Coverage

✅ **Requirement 3.1:** Display all payment methods (M-Pesa, Airtel, Telkom, Card)
✅ **Requirement 3.2:** M-Pesa STK push within 5 seconds
✅ **Requirement 3.3:** Airtel Money STK push within 5 seconds
✅ **Requirement 3.4:** Telkom Money STK push within 5 seconds
✅ **Requirement 3.5:** Secure card payment form with tokenization
✅ **Requirement 3.6:** Receipt generation within 10 seconds
✅ **Requirement 3.7:** Clear error messages and retry options

## Usage Example

```jsx
import PaymentForm from './RentManagement/PaymentForm';

function RentPayment() {
  const handlePaymentSuccess = (payment) => {
    console.log('Payment successful:', payment);
    // Update rent status, show notification, etc.
  };

  const handleCancel = () => {
    // Navigate back or close payment form
  };

  return (
    <PaymentForm
      amount={50000}
      dueDate="2025-11-05"
      propertyId="123"
      onSuccess={handlePaymentSuccess}
      onCancel={handleCancel}
    />
  );
}
```

## Testing

The implementation includes mock mode for development testing:
- Set `USE_MOCK = true` in `paymentService.js`
- Mock responses simulate real payment flows
- Random success/failure for testing error handling
- No actual API calls made in mock mode

## Next Steps

1. **Production Integration:**
   - Replace mock implementations with real API endpoints
   - Configure payment gateway credentials
   - Set up webhook handlers for payment callbacks

2. **PDF Generation:**
   - Integrate react-pdf for actual PDF generation
   - Add PDF download functionality

3. **Testing:**
   - Add unit tests for payment logic
   - Add integration tests for payment flows
   - Test with sandbox payment gateways

4. **Enhancements:**
   - Add payment history integration
   - Implement autopay setup
   - Add payment reminders
   - Support partial payments
