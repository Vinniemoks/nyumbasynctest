## Technical Implementation Details

### Notification Timing

- Autopay failure: Within 1 minute (simulated with 5-second delay)
- Scheduled payment reminder: 24 hours before (simulated immediately in demo)

### Background Monitoring
Both autopayProcessor and scheduledPaymentProcessor include monitoring services that:
- Check for due payments every 60 minutes
- Send reminders at appropriate times
- Process payments on scheduled dates
- Can be started/stopped as needed

### Mock Data Implementation
All features work with mock data for development/testing:
- Mock autopay settings stored in `window.mockReminderSettings`
- Mock scheduled payments stored in `window.mockScheduledPayments`
- Mock notifications stored in `window.mockNotifications`

### Production Considerations
For production deployment:
1. Replace mock data with actual API calls
2. Implement backend scheduler for autopay/scheduled payments
3. Set up real SMS/email notification services
4. Configure payment gateway webhooks for real-time status updates
5. Implement proper error handling and retry logic
6. Add transaction logging and audit trails
7. Set up monitoring and alerting for failed payments
