- **Pending:** ~60% (continues polling)

### Card Payment:
- **Processing:** 2-second delay
- **Success Rate:** 100% (always succeeds in mock mode)

## Visual Indicators

## Known Limitations (Mock Mode)

1. **No Real Payments:** All payments are simulated
2. **Random Success:** Mobile money payments have random outcomes
3. **No Backend:** No actual API calls to payment gateways
4. **No PDF Generation:** Receipt download triggers print dialog
5. **No Persistence:** Payment data not saved to database

## Switching to Production Mode

To enable real payment processing:

1. Open `src/services/paymentService.js`
2. Change `USE_MOCK = false`
3. Configure environment variables:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-api.com/api
   VITE_MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY=your_key
   VITE_MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_secret
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_key
   ```
4. Set up backend webhook endpoints
5. Test with sandbox credentials first

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Form Not Showing:
- Check console for errors
- Verify all components are imported correctly
